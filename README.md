# OLYMPICS-
The seven years of Olympic games, from 2000 to 2012, make up the Olympic dataset.

The procedures I used to obtain insights from the Olympic dataset were as follows:

* uploaded the Olympic dataset on MySQL Workbench
*  filtered the dataset using SQL queries to output the seven years of Olympic games
*  uploaded the dataset on Power-Bi 
*  performed data transformation on the Olympic dataset
*  performed data modeling on the Olympic dataset
*  visualized the dataset on the report pannal, using 
*         filters
*         cards
*         tables(conditional formatting and field formatting)

    performed DAX function on the dataset
        count function
        Top N
        Basic filtering
        
  The repository contains the picture of that was taken.
